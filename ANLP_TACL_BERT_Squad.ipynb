        "We conducted an error analysis on the TACL-BERT and BERT models, both trained on the SQuAD 1.0 dataset and identified several reasons for incorrect predictions. Some potential reasons include imprecise context understanding, over-specificity or insufficient specificity, difficulties handling ambiguity, misinterpretation of questions, and sensitivity to phrasing and paraphrasing.\n",
        "TACL model:\n",
        "1.\tContext Understanding: The model fails to understand context accurately or comprehensively, leading to incorrect answers. Example: It answered \"reciprocating steam engines\" instead of \"steam turbines\" for 20th-century ship propulsion.\n",
        "2.\tSpecificity Issues: The model generated overly specific or insufficiently specific answers. Example: It answered, \"open loop system\" instead of \"open loop\" and \"hydrogen and helium\" instead of \"helium\" in two different questions.\n",
        "3.\tAmbiguity Handling: The model struggles a bit with ambiguous questions or those with multiple valid answers. Example: It answered \"Richard Trevithick and, separately, Oliver Evans\" instead of \"Oliver Evans\" for the creator of an engine using high-pressure steam in 1801.\n",
        "4.\tMisinterpretation or Misrepresentation: The model misunderstands questions, leading to incorrect predictions. Example: It answered \"edge railed rack and pinion Middleton Railway\" instead of \"Middleton Railway\" for the railroad where Salamanca was used.\n",
        "5.\tImplicit Information Capture: The model struggles to capture implicit information or answer questions requiring deeper context understanding. Example: It answered \"relatively little work is required to drive the pump\" instead of the more specific answer about the Rankine cycle's compression stage.\n",
        "6.\tSensitivity to Phrasing and Paraphrasing: The model could have difficulty with differently phrased or paraphrased questions due to biases or the inability to generalize. Example: It answered \"turbine type steam engines\" instead of \"turbine\" for the steam engine producing most electricity today.\n",
        "BERT Model:\n",
        "2.\tContext understanding: BERT struggles with context, leading to incorrect answers. Example: Answering \"the source of most of the chemical energy\" instead of \"chemical energy\" for oxygen's role in combustion.\n",
        "3.\tIncorrect information extraction: BERT extracts wrong information from the text. Example: Answering \"light sky-blue color\" for the clarity of liquid oxygen, instead of \"clear.\"\n",
        "Areas where both models fail, but TACL performs better:\n",
        "1.\tDisambiguation: TACL outperforms BERT in disambiguating concepts. Example: TACL correctly answers \"methane\" as the primary component of natural gas, while BERT lists multiple components.\n",
        "2.\tAnswer specificity: TACL provides more specific answers than BERT. Example: TACL answers \"to generate ATP through cellular respiration\" for mitochondria's role, while BERT answers \"energy production.\"\n",
        "Both models encounter challenges in handling ambiguity, as demonstrated by their inability to correctly answer a question about the creator of a high-pressure steam engine in 1801. Misinterpretation of questions also led to errors, such as when the model provided a more technical response to a question about the railroad on which Salamanca was used.\n",
        "Despite these limitations, TACL-BERT generally outperforms BERT-base-uncased in areas such as context understanding, information extraction, disambiguation, and specificity. This improvement can be attributed to factors like better context comprehension, more accurate extraction, superior disambiguation capabilities, and the generation of more specific answers.\n",
        "Additional Analysis from the paper: The authors could have investigated the model's performance on questions that require an understanding of implicit information or context. They could have performed a more granular analysis of the questions based on the level of context required, which might have helped identify specific areas where the model needs improvement. The authors could have examined the model's sensitivity to phrasing and paraphrasing by creating multiple versions of the same question with different linguistic structures. Analyzing the model's performance on these variations would help identify any biases in the training data or areas where the model struggles to generalize. They could have analyzed the model's performance across different data splits, including varying levels of question similarity between the training and evaluation sets. This would help identify any overfitting issues and provide insights into the model's ability to generalize to new questions.\n",
        "Despite these limitations, TACL-BERT generally outperforms BERT-base-uncased in areas such as context understanding, information extraction, disambiguation, and specificity. The performance of TACL-BERT, both in terms of failures and improvements over the BERT model, can be attributed to several factors. First, the architecture of TACL-BERT allows for more effective context comprehension, which aids in understanding complex questions and producing more accurate answers. Second, the model's enhanced information extraction capabilities enable it to identify and focus on relevant textual information. Third, the TACL-BERT model exhibits superior disambiguation skills, allowing it to distinguish between similar concepts and determine the most appropriate response. Lastly, the model tends to generate more specific answers, which can be beneficial in certain cases but can also lead to over-specificity issues. These attributes contribute to TACL-BERT's overall performance, with the model outperforming BERT in several areas while still facing challenges in handling ambiguity and certain question types.\n",
        "In conclusion, the errors in TACL-BERT and BERT models can stem from factors such as preprocessing, tokenization, model architecture, training data, and hyperparameter tuning. While both models have limitations in understanding context, extracting correct information, disambiguating concepts, and providing sufficiently specific answers, TACL-BERT typically performs better in these areas. Further investigation and optimization of these models can lead to a more accurate and reliable performance in question-answering tasks.\n"

        "In the sample unit test, we used the sentence \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" as input for both the TACL and BERT models. This sentence is commonly used as it contains every letter of the English alphabet, making it a good choice for testing token representations. The test results showed that the TACL self-similarity was 0.3019, while the BERT self-similarity was 0.4077. TACL achieved better self-similarity scores due to its training process, which specifically optimizes the model for isotropic token representation spaces. In other words, TACL encourages more uniform and evenly distributed token embeddings, leading to better generalization and performance on downstream tasks. This is evident in the lower self-similarity score for TACL compared to BERT in the unit test, which suggests that the TACL model captures more nuanced and distinct features for each token."
