# ANLP TaCL BERT SQuAD

This repository contains the implementation of a BERT model for the SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) task. The purpose of this project is to explore and fine-tune the BERT model on the SQuAD dataset for question-answering tasks.

The repository includes two options for running the project:

1. A Jupyter Notebook called `ANLP_TACL_BERT_Squad.ipynb`.
2. A Google Colab Notebook available at [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1L4G4vDVSalVI2ZqTW3Ti0UxA80ofjz2W?usp=sharing).

Both notebooks contain the same content and can be used to train and evaluate the BERT model on the SQuAD dataset.
