# ANLP TaCL BERT SQuAD

This repository contains the implementation of a BERT model for the SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) task. The purpose of this project is to explore and fine-tune the BERT model on the SQuAD dataset for question-answering tasks.

The repository includes two options for running the project:

1. A Jupyter Notebook called `ANLP_TACL_BERT_Squad.ipynb`.
2. A Google Colab Notebook available at [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1L4G4vDVSalVI2ZqTW3Ti0UxA80ofjz2W?usp=sharing).

Both notebooks contain the same content and can be used to train and evaluate the BERT model on the SQuAD dataset.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following software installed on your system:

- Python 3.6 or later
- Jupyter Notebook (if using the local notebook)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sandeep-varma8029/ANLP_TaCL_BERT.git
Navigate to the cloned repository:
bash
Copy code
cd ANLP_TaCL_BERT
Install the required Python packages using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Local Notebook
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the ANLP_TACL_BERT_Squad.ipynb notebook from the Jupyter Notebook interface.

Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the BERT model on the SQuAD dataset.

Running the Google Colab Notebook
Open the Google Colab Notebook.

If you have a Google account, save a copy of the notebook to your Google Drive by clicking File > Save a copy in Drive.

Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the BERT model on the SQuAD dataset.

Notebook Overview
Both the ANLP_TACL_BERT_Squad.ipynb and the Google Colab Notebook consist of the following sections:

Introduction: Provides an overview of the BERT model and the SQuAD dataset.
Loading and Preprocessing Data: Describes how to load and preprocess the SQuAD dataset for use with the BERT model.
Model Implementation: Provides the code for implementing the BERT model using the Hugging Face Transformers library.
Training: Describes how to train the BERT model on the SQuAD dataset.
Evaluation: Provides the code for evaluating the performance of the trained BERT model on the SQuAD dataset.
Inference: Demonstrates how to use the trained BERT model to answer questions based on a given context.
