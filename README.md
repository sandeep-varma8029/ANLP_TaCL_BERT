# ANLP TaCL BERT SQuAD

This repository contains the implementation of a BERT model for the SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) task. The purpose of this project is to explore and fine-tune the BERT model on the SQuAD dataset for question-answering tasks.

The repository includes two options for running the project:

1. A Jupyter Notebook called `ANLP_TACL_BERT_Squad.ipynb`.
2. A Google Colab Notebook available at [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1L4G4vDVSalVI2ZqTW3Ti0UxA80ofjz2W?usp=sharing).

Both notebooks contain the same content and can be used to train and evaluate the BERT model on the SQuAD dataset.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following software installed on your system:

- Python 3.6 or later
- Jupyter Notebook (if using the local notebook)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sandeep-varma8029/ANLP_TaCL_BERT.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
```bash
cd ANLP_TaCL_BERT
```
3. Install the required Python packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
## Running the Local Notebook
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```
2. Open the ANLP_TACL_BERT_Squad.ipynb notebook from the Jupyter Notebook interface.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the BERT model on the SQuAD dataset.

## Running the Google Colab Notebook
1. Open the Google Colab Notebook.

2. If you have a Google account, save a copy of the notebook to your Google Drive by clicking File > Save a copy in Drive.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the BERT model on the SQuAD dataset.
